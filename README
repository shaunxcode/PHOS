PHOS is a php meta-object system 
Some of the principal ideas are borrowed from CLOS and Smalltalk
One of my pet peaves w/ development in almost all languages is the lack of ability to modify ONE method at a time w/o the boiler plate and clutter of all the other methods and signatures. Rather than utilizing an image based approach I am trying to utilize the file structure as the image by having each method be its own file.

FUTURE:
ability for static typing i.e.
(Inches $inches, Float $velocity)
return $inches * $velocity; 

Would compile into a function which did type checking on the arguments before the body was reached throwing the appropriate exception. 

ability to have "rest" args i.e
($a, $b . $rest) 

Again can be compiled into 
$rest = func_get_args();
$a = array_shift($args);
$b = array_shift($args);
