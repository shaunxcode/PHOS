PHOS is a php meta-object system 
Some of the principal ideas are borrowed from CLOS and Smalltalk
One of my pet peaves w/ development in almost all languages is the lack of ability to modify ONE method at a time w/o the boiler plate and clutter of all the other methods and signatures. Rather than utilizing an image based approach I am trying to utilize the file structure as the image by having each method be its own file.

WHAT IT IS NOT:
this is not a new language - it is merely a subset of php with a few restricitons i.e. no public properties what so ever.

WHAT IS WORKING:
Basically nothing - right now this is a rough sketch. But principally the only magic going on is that the method files will be compiled in such a way that if the first line contains a ( it will assume an argument list. If not it will assume an implict body. i.e. no need for { }. This means for one line methods with no arguments they could be as simple as:
	return $this->property
I am thinking of checking for last token being a ; so that this would be possible. 

A more normal method named perhaps public/multiply file might be more like:
	($x, $y)
	$this->recordAction("Multiplying $x by $y");
	return $x * $y;

This would be compiled into 

	public function multiply$x, $y) {
		$this->recordAction("Multiplying $x by $y");
		return $x * $y;
	}

As you can see this is really about using meaningful filenames and minimal syntactic sugar to reduce boiler plate. 

GOALS:
Provide a robust system in which the way objects are composed and maintained can be customized by the developer.

TODO:
* determine how to handle inheritence and mixins. Do I go with more meta info in filenames or do we need some sort of config file per class which indicates extension and mixin? 

* determine best way to handle generating the classes as they are modified - I imagine at "develop time" it will just regenerate them every time (unless this proves to be insanely slow) - I have considered perhaps doing some sort of checksum on the entirety of the files in the class dir? 
 
FUTURE:
ability for static typing i.e.
(Inches $inches, Float $velocity)
return $inches * $velocity; 

Would compile into a function which did type checking on the arguments before the body was reached throwing the appropriate exception. 

ability to have "rest" args i.e
($a, $b . $rest) 

Again can be compiled into 
$rest = func_get_args();
$a = array_shift($args);
$b = array_shift($args); 

What about allowing properties to be "accessbile" ala ruby so it implicitly creates getter/setters? 
properties/weight.Pounds.accessible ?
